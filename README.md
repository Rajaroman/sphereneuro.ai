# Sphereneuro.ai — Free Website
This is a minimal, responsive one‑page site you can host **for free**.

## Quick Start
1. Download the ZIP and extract it.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. Edit the text in `index.html` (contact email, links) as needed.

## Free Hosting Options
### GitHub Pages (recommended)
1. Create a repository named `sphereneuro-site` (any name is fine).
2. Upload all files in this folder (index.html, style.css, script.js, assets/).
3. In repo settings → Pages → Select `main` branch `/root` → Save.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/sphereneuro-site/`.
5. Later, add your custom domain (e.g., `sphereneuro.ai`) from Pages settings.

### Netlify (no Git required)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com and click **New site from Git** or **Deploy manually**.
2. Drag‑and‑drop this folder; Netlify gives you a free URL like `https://sphereneuroai.netlify.app`.

### Cloudflare Pages
1. Create a project → **Upload assets** → Drop this folder.
2. Get a free URL and add your custom domain easily.

### Hostinger (File Manager)
1. In hPanel, open **File Manager** for your hosting → `public_html/`.
2. Upload the contents of this folder (not the outer folder itself).
3. Ensure your domain points to this hosting plan.
4. Visit your domain to see the site live.

## Customize
- Colors and spacing are in `style.css`.
- Replace `assets/favicon.svg` with your logo (same name) if you like.
- Add new sections by copying the existing `<section>` blocks.
